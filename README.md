## Introduction

Hello! I'm a student at **Blue Mountain Christian University**, where I balance my academic pursuits with a passion for athletics. I play baseball and enjoy being part of a team, both on and off the field. My long-term aspiration is to become a **software developer**, building applications that make a difference.
