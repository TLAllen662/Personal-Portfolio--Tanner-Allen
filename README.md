# Personal-Portfolio--Tanner-Allen

## 🎉 Introduction

Hey there! 👋 I'm a proud student at **Blue Mountain Christian University**, where I mix late-night study sessions with baseball practice and good times with teammates. ⚾ Outside of the classroom, you'll usually find me on the diamond or tinkering with code as I chase my dream of becoming a **software developer** 🖥️💡

This portfolio is a snapshot of my journey—learning, growing, and having fun along the way.
